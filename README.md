# Reservoir Simulation Report Tool

The Reservoir Simulation Report Tool is a Python-based tool that automates the generation of reservoir simulation Excel reports using the Resinsight software. It provides a convenient and efficient solution for reservoir engineers to create comprehensive reports for their simulation results.

## Features

- Generates reservoir simulation Excel reports with customizable templates.
- Extracts relevant data from Resinsight, including well information, fluid characteristics, production and injection rates,
   hydrocarbons originally in place, and pressure.
- Streamlines the reporting process, eliminating the need for manual data extraction and formatting.
